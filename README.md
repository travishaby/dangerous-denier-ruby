# dangerous-denver-ruby
Same data analysis as previous dangerous-denver in JS using lodash but done in Ruby to contrast the implementation that javascript allows.
I sort of purposefully wrote it in non-object-oriented manner, and admittedly in a large, disgusting method.

This is the original project assignment for javascript: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/dangerous-denver
